# Build Artifacts

Each PR-update and PR-merge causes a GitHub Workflow to execute that generates and
publishes build artifacts (the draft compiled in its various formats) to be published to the
[Build artifacts for YANG XML](https://netmod-wg.github.io/yang-xml)
page.


# Attribution

The Contributors list is automatically calculated by sorting all of the
GitHub-contributors by "total" lines added, removed, and changed.  If you want to be
listed as a contributor, you must contribute to a PR that gets merged.  Of course, the
"designated experts" may contribute PRs too, but they cannot review their own PR ;)
